*************  Welcome to this Stanford Dogs project completed by Efkan Turedi *********************


There are couple of files contained in this folder:
    - Notebook non cleared containing our code and thought process
    - Utils files to support our notebook
    - A presentation 
    - A draw io file containing a diagramme used in the presentation

Given the high number of neural networks, we recommend using powerful GPUs. We used AWS's 4cores + 16GB RAM + 1GPU EC2 to run our notebook which completes in 5h of running time. 

For storing the images, we recommend using Amazon S3 buckets as a cheap way to store and request

The latest version of the presentation is available here (view mode only):

We hope you enjoy this project, and here is my e-mail for any questions or requests:

Have a great day,  

Efkan
